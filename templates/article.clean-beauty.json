Humans are not rats.<br\/>2. Injecting something into the bloodstream is not the same as applying it topically.<br\/>3. The amount injected into the rat far exceeded any amount someone would realistically be exposed to.<\/em><\/p><p><br\/><strong>So, knowing that — did the study accurately measure what it intended to measure?<\/strong><\/p><p>No. They intended to measure if<strong> <\/strong><em>topical application<\/em><strong> <\/strong>of parabens<strong>  <\/strong>would cause endocrine disruption in <em>humans<\/em>, but the study tested <em>injected application in rats<\/em>.<\/p><p><br\/><strong>Did they generalize the findings beyond the study sample?<\/strong><\/p><p>Absolutely.
